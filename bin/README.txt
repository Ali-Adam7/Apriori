The project is implemented in Java. Each algorithm is in a file, to run the algorithm you need to run the file as a java application. the algorithms are in the main method of each file.
The Pair.java file is the pairs class. Mutable Short file is the wrapper object for the count in the hash map

Method.java is where all the functions are stored, each algorithm will call some functions from that file. All functions are documented.

The text files in Frequent Pairs folder are the frequent pairs for each algorthim and data set and threshold.

In each algorithm file there are variabes that you could change such as the threshold, dataset file name ...etc

To change the dataset go to File variable: 
File file = new File("./retail.txt") and change retail.txt to the dataset name
